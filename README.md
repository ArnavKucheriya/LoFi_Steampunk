# Installation and Setup Guide for LoFi Steampunk

Follow these steps to install and run the LoFi Steampunk project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (includes npm)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArnavKucheriya/LoFi_Steampunk.git
cd LoFi_Steampunk
```

## Install Dependencies

Navigate into the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

This will download and install all necessary packages listed in `package.json`.

## Running the Project

After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server.

### Run in Development Mode

To start the project in development mode, which will enable hot-reloading for any code changes, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start a development server, and the project should open automatically in your default browser. If it doesn’t, open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

### Build for Production

To create an optimized production build of the project, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `build` folder with optimized files that can be deployed to a server or static hosting platform.

### Running the Production Build Locally (Optional)

If you want to test the production build locally, you can use a simple HTTP server. First, make sure you have the `serve` package installed:

```bash
npm install -g serve
```

Then, serve the build folder:

```bash
serve -s build
```

This will start a server and provide a link to access the production version of the project.

## Additional Commands

Here are some additional npm commands you may find useful:

- **Linting**: Check for code style issues
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```
- **Testing**: Run tests (if tests are configured in the project)
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup or installation, consider the following:

- Ensure Node.js and npm are installed and up to date.
- Make sure you’re in the correct directory (`LoFi_Steampunk`) when running commands.
- If dependencies aren’t installing, try deleting `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install` again.
